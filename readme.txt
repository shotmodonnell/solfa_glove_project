The files in this repo work together on the Solfa Glove project that I have made.

It requires the Arduino Adafruit BNO055 library, as well as themidibus processing library.

The arduino code is to be run on an arduino with a BNO055 rotation sensor and switch, this is to be connected over USB to a computer running the processing sketch.

It maps the gestures of tonic solfa to rotation and a switch, meaning that a glove with rotation sensor and switch can determine what solfa hand sign is being made.

Currently, work is being done on the project to introduce new modes of use and to make it more robust.
